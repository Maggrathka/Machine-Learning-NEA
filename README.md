# Machine-Learning-NEA
A Coursework project in which I developed a neural network to classify the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits using backpropagation.

A_Artificial_Neural_Network.py is the trainer while Drawing.py is the visualizer.
Included is a write-up, named NEA.py. This details all the steps taken to completing this project.

Note:
I purposefully went without the use of numpy, this was to ensure I understood all aspects of the training process - not abstracting away potentially important details.
