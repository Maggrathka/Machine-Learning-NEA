# Machine-Learning-NEA
A Coursework project in which I developed a neural network to classify the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits using backpropagation.

Note:
I purposefully went without the use of numpy, this was to ensure I understood all aspects of the training process - not abstracting away potentially important details.
